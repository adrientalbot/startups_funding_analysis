# Start-ups/Scale-ups' success' survivability analysis

As part of my Master's degree at Imperial, I conducted some research on the funding of startups given a Crunchbase data set detailing the financing of 50,000 startups/scaleups until 2013. I chose this topic because of my deep interest in venture capital and startups in general and I wanted to learn more about what are the most important factors that determine the success of certain companies (also other than funding) such sector, country etc.
